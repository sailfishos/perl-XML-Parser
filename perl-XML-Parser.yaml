Description: |
    This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is built on top
    of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
    Clark's expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates
    a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the
    document. Expat options may be provided when the XML::Parser object is
    created. These options are then passed on to the Expat object on each
    parse call. They can also be given as extra arguments to the parse
    methods, in which case they override options given at XML::Parser
    creation time.
